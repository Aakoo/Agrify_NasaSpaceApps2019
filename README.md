Within the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019, Sfax, Brainstormed and Developed a PoC (Proof of Concept) in 24 hours hackathon, where we developed a Decision Support System that analyses Imagery data and indicators issued directly from NASA earth data imagery to display analysis and datum visualization (precipitations, NDVI & EVI Index, Soil moisture. Etc..) to help the farmers in the decision-making process to reduce water and energy consumption and promote sustainable agriculture.
The Web App mixes and matches data form several Satellites and sources (MODIS, NOAA, Landsat) in WMS, WMTS and KML formats.
